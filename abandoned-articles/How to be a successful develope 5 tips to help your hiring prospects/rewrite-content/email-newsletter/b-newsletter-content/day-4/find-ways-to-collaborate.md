## Find ways to collaborate

Remote working might afford us greater flexibility and a better work-life balance, but it's undoubtedly also made collaboration more difficult.

Particularly when you're working in software development, effective communication and teamwork are essential to keeping projects on track and on time, knowing who's working on what and generally making the working day more interesting.

Companies are gradually sending employees back to the office, although it's perhaps not a return to office life as we once knew it.

Developers have been particularly vocal about their desire to continue remote working indefinitely;

if they are to get their wish, tech teams will have to get more creative about how they collaborate when they're not sitting across a desk from each other.

This could be allocating days when teams meet up to work from the office, virtual brainstorming sessions over Zoom, Teams or Google Meet, sharing their to-do lists on platforms like Trello or Asana, or simply maintaining a healthy chat on Slack.

How you do it is really up to you, but keeping communication flowing will not just ensure you stay productive at work, but will also make work itself a lot more enjoyable.
