## Have a thirst for knowledge

Learning on the job is the key to any successful career, and given the fast-moving nature of the software industry, being open to new projects and programs will keep your work interesting and your skills sharp.

Thanks to the rising popularity of coding bootcamps, online-learning platforms and free web resources, you no longer need to hold a computer science degree to become a programming whiz.

If you're passionate about coding, your education won't stop at the end of the workday either. YouTube, Github, Stack Overflow, W3Schools and FreeCodeCamp offer a multitude of ways you can continue to learn new skills and refine existing ones in your spare time at no extra cost.

There is also a wealth of paid-for online-training platforms where you can learn new programming languages, tools and frameworks. Some of the most popular include CodeAcademy, Udemy, PluralSight and Udacity.

Alternatively, you could spend your free time contributing to open-source projects like Django, Srapy, Tensorflow and the Python project.
