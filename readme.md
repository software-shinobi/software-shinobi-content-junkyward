## Disclaimer

This is my digital junk drawer. Everything from half-finished projects to random scripts I wrote while tripping on caffeine is in here. I'm talking raw, uncut code. No filters, no promises.

Think of it as a treasure chest... or a dumpster. You might find gold, you might find garbage. It's a gamble, buddy.

I've tried to clean it up a bit, but let's be real, I'm not a maid. So, if you find something weird, don't blame me. Blame my past self.
