## Work on your 'soft' skills

We've already stressed the importance of robust technical skills for a career in coding, but they don't account for everything: your interpersonal skills are also a key facet of your future success.

You could be a JavaScript dynamo, but this won't account for much if you're lacking in the type of 'soft' skills that employers are looking for.

Think about it from the company's perspective: if it came down to the choice between two candidates, the hiring manager is far more likely to go with the person who has a few gaps in their coding ability but is open-minded, adaptable and a great communicator, as opposed to the candidate who thinks they know everything there is to learn about JavaScript and prefers to work as a one-person team.

The key is to think about the type of person you would want to work with and emulate those qualities.
