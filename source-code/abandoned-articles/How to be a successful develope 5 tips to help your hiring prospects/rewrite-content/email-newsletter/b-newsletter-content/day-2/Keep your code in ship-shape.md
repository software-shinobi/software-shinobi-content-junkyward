subject line: Running For Beginners

Hello "autoresponder code here",

In the last issue we talked about few basic training tips for
beginning your running routine. In this issue we are going to go over
setting up a basic schedule for beginning your running training.

# Keep your code in ship-shape

This one seems pretty obvious, but given that one of the topmost complaints of developers -- not to mention one of the biggest sources of developer burnout -- is hunting for bugs in code, the value of being able to write clean, high-quality code should not be understated.

The more time you can spend making sure your code is error-free, the less time that needs to be spent on backtracking through old submits to figure out where things have gone wrong.

Or, even worse, explaining to customers, clients and co-workers why your product doesn't work as intended.

Your fellow developers will also like you a lot more if they don't have to spend their precious time double or triple checking your work for issues.

Speed and quality is not an easy combo to crack, particularly given the tight deadlines and limited resources that dev teams typically work with.

But having a reputation as a diligent and meticulous coder is something that will always catch the attention of recruiters.
