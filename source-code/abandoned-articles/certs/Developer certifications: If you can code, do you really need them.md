# What This Senior Full Stack Developer Thinks About IT Certifications [2023]

## Introduction

I've been a software developer for over 18 years.

In this Article, I share my thoughts about IT Certifications for Software Developers and Aspiring Technologists.

## The Never Ending Debate About Certs

IT Certifications are a polarizing discussion.

To say the least.

Find any IT related message board or Facebook Group or Sub-Reddit and just look for a post about IT Certifications.

What you'll find is largely two groups of people with strong opinions about Job Seekers using Certs in the modern Job Market.

Obviously, the two groups being those who identify as "PRO Certs" and "ANTI Certs".

## Am I PRO or ANTI Certs For Developers?

For transparencies sake...

I am ANTI IT Certifications.

Especially for Software Developers.

More importantly, I am ANTI IT Certifications for any job function that is focused on "Creation".

More on all of that later, down below.

## IT Certs Are Marketed As A One-Up In The Job Search

Marketing Matters...

Of course the certifying bodies and vendors market their products with claims that a "certified" technologist has some implied advantage over other candidates during a job search.

But those involved in the business of hiring developers often have a different opinion.

## More Certs, More Problems?

One rather wid]espread belief is that developers who advertise their multiple certifications are actually less desirable for hire.

Yes, you read that correctly.

This position is both counterintuitive and perhaps troubling for many.

It's easy to think a passing grade on a certification test provides evidence of skill and capability.

## Understanding The Stigma Behind Certifications

The stigma commonly associated with certifications today is rather complex and likely related to the culture and psyche of the tech community.

The Tech community buy and large favors meritocracy over credentialism.

Certification tests show that you would choose testing as a means of gaining industry credibility.

That's... not a good thing.

## The Rise of The Certification House

When the dot-com boom of the 1990s exponentially increased demand for technologists virtually overnight.

accelerated training programs were established and marketed as an efficient alternative to a college degree for busy professionals.

Many of these programs offered a certificate upon completion, and these certificates were typically affiliated with a vendor technology.

## IT Certification Tests As A Business Model

The training programs proved to be a massive financial success, and companies such as Brainbench recognized the opportunity to offer both new industry entrants and experienced professionals a certificate via testing without the training.

The number of certifying bodies and individual tests continued to grow, and it was not uncommon to see developer résumés showcasing laundry lists of acronyms and identification numbers that indicated their testing accomplishments.

Technology vendors such as Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, and IBM got into the mix with their own cash-cow certificate programs, and a hierarchy of certifiers began to take shape among various language and product camps. 

## Initial reactions To IT Certifications

In the early days, certifications garnered significant credibility and acceptance among developers and hiring authorities alike.

Many companies listed specific certifications as a nice-to-have on job specs, while others actually required testing as a condition of employment.

Developers naturally began to feel some pressure, as their marketability was increasingly being tied to their test-taking ability instead of coding.

Admissions of failed certification attempts became harmful, while certifying bodies raised the bar by adding required wait times to retake a test after any failure.

## When The Certified Developer Can't Code

With more and more certified developers entering the market, it was soon revealed that a certification was no guarantee of ability.

This realization often (thankfully) came during technical interviews, where applicants holding multiple certifications were unable to complete even the most basic programming tasks.

In more unfortunate circumstances, some companies that hired contractors sans interview using certifications as their only filter and vetting method now had unskilled developers on their payrolls. 

## The IT Certification backlash Over Time

Anecdotes and horror stories about highly certified developers performing poorly in real-world situations spread, and a vast number of employers removed certifications from candidate assessments and hiring criteria.

Over time, the thought that a certification wasn't a reliable indicator for talent morphed into the idea that a listed certification might actually indicate a lack of ability.

## Experienced Developers Do Not Think Highly Of Certifications

This sentiment is evidenced by comments from multiple industry thought leaders on threads at Hacker News and Quora. One commenter on a Stack Exchange thread summed up many developers' opinions succinctly:

"There's definitely the attitude that if you need a certificate, then you can't really program, and if you actually can program then you don't waste your time on certificates."

## You Were Doing Anything Except Creation

As quickly as certifications had come into favor, the acronyms became scarlet letters on résumés that identified the holder as someone who'd been suckered into wasting time and money on a mostly worthless item.

The true value of a certification lies solely in the process of studying for the exam itself. 

## Should You Mention Certifications On Your Resume

In my experience, it's now become a common suggestion for job seekers to omit any mention of earned certifications from résumés.

It may be difficult to fathom, but given two virtually identical résumés—with only one having certifications—many hiring managers would rate the candidate without the certs as more desirable.

## Junior Developeres And Certifications 

Junior-level developers are often given a pass when it comes to listing certifications, since they often have to rely on any possible accreditation to get noticed by employers. I often see certifications disappear from résumés as experience increases.

## Maker culture: Why study when you can code?

The rising popularity of certifications was closely followed by ubiquitous access to inexpensive, user-friendly development tools.

In the late '90s, certification as a means to demonstrate ability made more sense than it does today due to the limitations of the times. Frankly, certification was more convenient.

## There Are Better Ways To Brand Yourself Than An IT Certification

Modern developers have more options when it comes to building their brands and investing time and money in career development.

If today's Java developer wants to show her expertise, she can get a working application up and running at no cost, and perhaps in a fraction of the time she might have spent studying for the certification test. 

## The Shift In Reputation Over Time

IT Certifications are marketed to millions of people worldwide.

However, the industry reputation of certifications and those who flaunt them has changed significantly over time.

For the worse.

## Summary

Few things are more polarizing than the topic of IT certifications in the modern job market.

There are many opinions on the role that certifications have to play for Software Developers.

I personally feel (and I'm not alone in doing so) that the most capable developers are much more likely not to have certifications.

Instead, they'll be using that potential IT Certification study time to write, commit and deploy code.
